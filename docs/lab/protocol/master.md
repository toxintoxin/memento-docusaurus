## Mammalian sample collection and extraction

### Collection of mammalian samples

#### From cell culture

- Plate cells so that they have about the same confluency at the time of cell harvest. **This is very important. Confluency greatly influences lipid concentration!**
- You need one confluent 6 or 10cm dish per lipid extraction.
- Cell collection can be done under non-sterile conditions on the bench.
- Take off medium and wash cells carefully with ice-cold PBS.
- Place cells on ice; tilt the dish so that remaining rest of PBS can be collected. Never let the cells dry out! Always close the lid.
- Add 500μl of fresh ice cold PBS per plate. Scrape the cells off the dish using a Costar cell lifter. Work on ice, try to be fast, collect cells on one side of the dish.
- Transfer 500μl cell suspension to a 1.5 ml  eppendorf tube.
- Take an aliquot aside for BCA protein assay (typically 50μl)
- Spin down cells at 2500rpm, 5min, 4°C.
- Take off the PBS using a pipet (do not aspirate). The cell pellets can be frozen at -20°C or directly used for BCA assay and lipid extraction.
- For BCA assay : resuspend pellet in 55μl of lysis buffer (M-PER, Thermo Scientific).
- For lipid extraction: continue with MTBE extraction protocol.

#### From tissue

Best way is to pulverize the tissue in liquid nitrogen. If this is not possible, this is very important to have at least pieces of the same size.

- Remove the tubes from the heating block and let them cool down at room temperature for at least 5 minutes.
- Prepare the reaction solution (this has to be prepared fresh, because the solutions are not stable for a long time) : H2O / 1.25% NH4Molybdate / 1.67% ascorbic acid (5:2:1 v/v)
- Put a marble on each tube to prevent evaporation
- Incubate the tubes at 100°C for 5 minutes in a heating block

## Phospholipids and Sphingolipids : Sample preparation, running on TSQ and analysis through the pipeline

### Sample preparation

- Resuspend samples in 250 μl chloroform / methanol (CHROMASOLV LC-MS grade, 1:1, v/v) and sonicate for 5 minutes.
- Always work with Hamilton syringes.
- Dilutions of the samples are made directly in an Eppendorf twin.tec PCR 96 well plate to a final volume of 100 μl. Take up the solvent first and then fill up to 100 μl with your sample. For example, for PC, PE take up 99 μl of solvent then 1 μl of sample and pipette into the appropriate well.
- Cover your wells with parafilm to avoid evaporation of your sample during pipetting.
- After you are done, seal the plate with Easy Pierce 20μm Foil (Thermo Scientific).
- Samples should be run immediately. Alternatively, they can be stored overnight at 4°C.  Stored samples need to be sonicated before use.

### Sample Running on the Mass Spectrometer (TSQ Vantage)

- Prepare a .csv sample file for the sequence on the TSQ.
- Naming samples should follow this pattern: **FreeTextOnSample_MrmMethod_BiologicalReplicate_TechnicalReplicate**
- There are 4 different MRM methods:
  > p1 (positive mode, TL)  
  > p2 (positive mode, SL)  
  > n1 (negative mode, TL)  
  > n2 (negative mode, SL)  
- Biological and technical replicates should be named in numerical or alphabetical order. **Example:** Con_p1_1_1 or Con_p1_1_A means: Control (Con)_positive mode TL_biological replicate 1_technical replicate 1.
- Be careful with the naming of the folder and of the files since it is very important if you want to send the experiment through the calculation pipeline.
- At the end of the sequence have a quick look at the runs in Excalibur and check that everything is fine for all the samples.
- If there is one run with no signal rerun it immediately (same solvent, same time for the machine) and replace it in the raw file's folder. Zip the folder containing only the experimental raw files and load on http://lipidx.vital-it.ch/base/exps.

### Analysis on the LipidX pipeline

- Go to the http://lipidx.vital-it.ch/base/pages/1 website and log in with your user name.
- Go to “Experiments” (menu up the page) and click on New experiment (bottom of the page).
- Fill up the page (Experiment type: MRM analysis) and click on Create button.
- After a certain time the “Experiments” page appears, but the new experiment may not be listed, because it takes some time to convert the .raw files in .txt files.
- When the new experiment is listed, click on the link Show (right of the line). This will open a new page with a listing the experiment files and on top of it a line with different links.
- First, click on Standard concentrations and check that the amount of input for each standard is correct.
- Second, click on Signals. A page with a color code for the intensities appears. If the signal is missing for one of the cycle (very light pink, white), there is a possibility to eliminate it by clicking in the small box up the column. Click then on “Update cycle selection” (bottom right of the page). The data is now ready to be sent to the calculation part of the pipeline.
- Click on “Tools” (menu up the page), then on MRMquant (menu on the right of the page) and on  New MRMquant job (top or bottom of the page).
- Fill up the page, be careful with the selection of the calibration curve and click on create.
- Refresh the page until the message “Success” appears in the column status.
- The MRMquant job can then be seen by clicking on Show the (right of the line).
- To download a MRMquant job, select it by clicking in the box on the left and click on “Download”.
- The downloaded folder contains for each mode p1, n1, p2 and n2, the following . csv files:
  - concentrations_by_cycle
  - log10_median-signal
  - median_concentration
  - median_concentration_by_biorepl
  - st_dev_concentration
  - st_dev_log10_signals

## Sterols: Sample preparation, running on the VARIAN 320MS and analysis

### Sample preparation

- Resuspend samples in 250 μl chloroform/methanol (CHROMASOLV LC-MS grade, 1:1) and sonicate for 5 min.
- Dilute in the same solvent (C/M, 1:1).
  > Yeast : dilution 1:5  
  > Mammalian : dilution 1:2  
  > Worms : very low amount of sterols, big prep needed  
  > Flush the samples briefly with N2 to prevent oxidation of sterols.  

### Sample Running on the Mass Spectrometer (320MS)

- Fill the Sample List directly on the machine.
- For each sample load 5 μl.
- Run the method : 080604 FS sterols

### Analysis

- For each sterol, extract the specific ion.
  - Ergosterol (m/z = 396)
  - Cholesterol (m/z=386)
  - Ergosterol esters (m/z = 378)
  - Cholesterol esters (m/z = 368)
- Integrate the area under the peak.
- Transfer these values into Excel and calculate the quantities using the standard curves for cholesterol and ergosterol.

## Internal standards for LC-GC / MS

### Important

- Keep the standard solutions in amber glass vials.
- Always pipette the standards with Hamilton glass syringes.
- To avoid evaporation and variations, it is strongly recommended to prepare a set of standard mixes for several experiments and keep them dry at -80°C.
- Prepare this set of standard mixes for different numbers of samples (ex.: for 6, 12, and 24 samples) to avoid waste of standards.
- Always prepare at least one more standard mix than the number of samples, e.g. a standard mix for 25 samples will be sufficient for 24 samples. You will have losses on the tube wall and due to evaporation.
- Always use CHROMASOLV, LC-MS grade if possible, solvents.

The lipid standards are synthetic analogs of natural gycerophosphoipids and sphingolipids which can be obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. For sterol analysis we use cholesterol for yeast samples as standard since the endogenous sterol of yeast cells is ergosterol and ergosterol for mammalian samples and worms as the endogenous one is cholesterol.

#### Yeast standard mix

For the yeast, a mix of 7 different lipid standards is used for the glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid analysis and cholesterol for the sterol analysis

Glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid standard mix for 25OD :

| Standard | nmole | μl stock |
| -------- | ----- | -------- |
| PC31:1   | 7.5   | 7.5      |
| PE31:1   | 7.5   | 7.5      |

Cholesterol standard for 25OD :

| Standard    | nmole | μl stock |
| ----------- | ----- | -------- |
| Cholesterol | 20    | 20       |

#### Mammalian standard mix

For mammalian lipid analysis, a mix of 9 different lipid standards is used.

One mix is for a confluent 6-10cm dish of mammalian cells (≈ 1 x 106 CHO cells) or 20-30mg of tissue.

| Ergosterol | 8     | 8        |

#### Worm standard mix

For worm lipid analysis, a mix of 9 different lipid standards is used.

One mix is for 8000 worms.

| Standard       | nmole | μl stock |
| -------------- | ----- | -------- |
| DLPC           | 0.4   | 0.4      |

| C8GC           | 0.1   | 0.1      |
| C16 deoxyDHCer | 0.1   | 0.1      |

### Preparation of the standard mixes

#### Preparation of standards stock solutions

- Prepare a stock solution of 1.0 µmol/ml of each standard in Chloroform/Methanol (1:1).
- Confirm the concentration of PC, PE, PI, PS and CL by a phosphate assay.

#### Pipetting and handling

- Pipette the appropriate amount of each standard in a 2 ml amber vial.
- Dry and keep at -80°C.
- Just before use, resuspend the mix in the appropriate amount of Chloroform/methanol (1:1): (number of samples + 1) *20 or 25 μl.
- Vortex and sonicate for 5min.
- Add 20 or 25 μl of the standard mix or sterol standard to each sample at the beginning of the extraction (use Hamilton glass syringes).
